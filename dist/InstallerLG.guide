@{B}-----------------------------------------------------------------------@{UB}

InstallerLG is a reimplementation of the 'Installer' tool included with
AmigaOS as of version 2.1. InstallerLG aims to be fully compatible with
the original as described in the V44.10 guide. The resource limitations
found in the Commodore implementation are gone and the original GUI has
been replaced by a MUI/Zune based one.

@{B}Notes on compatibility with the CBM implementation@{UB}
@{B}-----------------------------------------------------------------------@{UB}

When executing InstallerLG from shell, the working directory will be set
to that of the installer script since that's what most scripts expect. I
have yet to find an exception to this rule. The Commodore installer does
not work like this. It doesn't change working directory which results in
most scripts failing unless executed from the directory of the script.

The implementation of (asknumber) is not identical with the installer in
AmigaOS. Instead of a string gadget, a slider is used to pick a value in
a given range. For aesthetic reasons the default range is 0-100 which is
less than the range used by the Commodore implementation.

The CBM installer uses 68060 as a fallback when using (database 'cpu' on
PowerPC (MorphOS) systems. InstallerLG will return the correct CPU. Some
scripts have a problem with this. I've considered this to be an unwanted
limitation of the CBM installer and therefore decided to report the true
value despite this breaking some scripts.

@{B}Features beyond those of the original@{UB}
@{B}-----------------------------------------------------------------------@{UB}

The error handling in the Commodore implementation is far from strict.
Installers often fail silently, giving the impression that the script
works / the installation succeeded, despite critical errors. To mimic
this behaviour, InstallerLG ignores a lot of problems per default. If
desired, stricter error handling can be enabled in runtime by setting
the variable \@strict to 1. When developing new scripts, this can save
a lot of frustration since it can help you detect problems like using
undefined variables, invalid string formats, file permission problems
and more. Please note that setting this variable won't break anything
if another interpreter is used.

Unlike the original AmigaOS implementation, the (effect) statement is
treated like any other statement by InstallerLG. This means that it's
possible to change effect during the installation.

The (database) function supports a new attribute, 'os', that makes it
possible for scripts to get the host OS without the guesswork used by
many multiplatform installers.

To be written: Headless.
To be written: Fake user input.

         Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
         made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
         either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
         Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
         Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
         months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
         (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
         has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
         ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
         Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

    3.3. Description of Modifications.

         You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
         file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
         the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
         the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
         Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
         Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
         Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
         origin or ownership of the Covered Code.

    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.

         (a) Third Party Claims.

             If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
             intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
             granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
             must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled
             "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim
             in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
             If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is
             made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall
             promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes
             available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying
             appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to
             inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has
             been obtained.

         (b) Contributor APIs.

             If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
             interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
             are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
             also include this information in the LEGAL file.

         (c) Representations.

             Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
             Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
             Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
             Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
             this License.

    3.5. Required Notices.

         You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
         Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
         Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in
         a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
         to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s)
         You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
         Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
         for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
         rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
         charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
         obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
         may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
         any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
         offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
         Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
         Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
         support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.

    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.

         You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
         requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
         and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
         the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
         including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
         obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
         in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
         collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
         Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
         Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
         contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
         compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
         Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
         rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
         License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
         license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
         from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
         Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
         Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
         the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
         terms You offer.

    3.7. Larger Works.

         You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
         not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
         Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
         requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
    with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
    License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and
    the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
    Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such
    description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill
    to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

    5.1. Attached license.

         This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
         attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.

    5.2. Detached license.

         This License applies to code which is part of a Source Tree
         containing this license in a file named LICENSE or license.html
         at the top of its hierarchy and which is not explicitly covered by a
         different license.

6. Versions of the License.

    6.1. New Versions.

         The AROS development team may publish revised and/or new versions of
         the License from time to time.  Each version will be given a
         distinguishing version number.

    6.2. Effect of New Versions.

         Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
         the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
         version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
         of any subsequent version of the License. No one other than the AROS
         development team has the right to modify the terms applicable to
         Covered Code created under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
    WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
    MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
    RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
    SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
    INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
    NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
    CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
    IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

    8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
         automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
         such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
         sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
         survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
         nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
         shall survive.

    8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim
         (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
         Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
         file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:

         (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
             infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
             Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
             shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
             prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
             You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually
             agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of
             Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your
             litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against
             such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable
             royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
             writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,
             the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or
             2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
             period specified above.

         (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
             Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent,
             then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections
             2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first
             made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by
             that Participant.

    8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging
         that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
         infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license
         or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement
         litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such
         Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in
         determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

    8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end
         user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
         have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
         termination shall survive termination.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
    ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
    INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
    SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR
    PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
    APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
    THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

    The Covered Code is a "commercial item", as that term is defined in 48
    C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
    and "commercial computer software documentation", as such terms are used
    in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and
    48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government
    End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
    enforceable.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of
    its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with
    Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an
    equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
    constitute any admission of liability.

13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
    "Multiple-Licensed". "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
    permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under alternative
    licenses specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in
    Exhibit A.

Building and testing InstallerLG
================================

Unless changes have been made to the parser or lexer, a simple 'make' will build
the 'Installer' binary. An lha archive suitable for distribution can be built by
invoking 'make dist' in the 'dist' directory. If modifications have been made to
the parser or the lexer, the parser.c|h and lexer.c files have to be regenerated
on a Linux system (or some other system with a recent Bison).

To execute the tests, a Linux system with Valgrind is recommended. It's possible
to run the tests on other systems with a POSIX shell but then no leaks / illegal
reads / writes or leaking file handles will be detected. By running 'make test',
all tests will be executed. All test suites should pass on Linux, MacOS, AmigaOS
and MorphOS. In order to run tests on AmigaOS or MorphOS LG_TEST must be defined
when building. Testing on AROS is not supported yet.

To build an interactive cli-based version of the installer the variable INTERFACE
can be set to CLI.  E.g.

make INTERFACE=CLI
make -f Makefile.vbcc INTERFACE=CLI
